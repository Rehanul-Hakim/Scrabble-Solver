# Scrabble-Solver
 Rudimentary code to solve a scrabble board.

To use the code:
	1. Open the "gui_code.py" file. This will open a window with the board.
	2. Select the cell, which will then be highlighted. Enter a number into the highlighted cell.
	3. Fill up the board with all the numbers where necessary.
	4. Once you're done, press the "Enter" key to see the final board.

Other features include:
	1. Press "R" to reset the board midway.

Current issues to be solved:
	1. Program crashes when you put in an unsolvable board.
	2. GUI can be made more smoothly.
	3. Mouse clicks doesn't always highlight the correct cell.
